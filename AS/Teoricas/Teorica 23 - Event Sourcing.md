# Event Sourcing

Overview:<br>
Event sourcing is a paradigm shift in business logic and persistence design. It stores aggregate states as a sequence of events, each representing a state change. The current state of an aggregate is derived by replaying these events. This technique aligns closely with domain-driven design (DDD), emphasizing domain events as core to aggregate changes.

Key Features and Benefits:

- Preservation of Aggregate History: Event sourcing maintains a complete history of changes to aggregates, supporting use cases like auditing and compliance.
- Reliable Domain Event Publishing: Events are intrinsically tied to state changes, eliminating the risk of forgetting to publish necessary events. This is especially valuable in microservice architectures for communication and synchronization.
- Support for CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Event sourcing often pairs with CQRS to handle complex queries.
- Optimistic Concurrency Handling: By handling events sequentially, event sourcing inherently supports concurrent updates to aggregates.
- Event-driven Applications: Each state transition generates events, fostering integration through event-driven designs like sagas or external notifications.

Drawbacks:

- Complex Querying: Querying current states directly from events can be challenging, requiring strategies like snapshots or CQRS.
- Steeper Learning Curve: Developers must adapt to a fundamentally different approach compared to traditional database-centric methods.
- Handling Evolving Events: Managing changes to event schemas over time introduces additional complexity.

Implementation Details:

- Events are stored in an event store, a hybrid database/message broker designed for this purpose. The aggregate state is reconstructed by replaying its events or using snapshots to improve efficiency.
- Event handling methods are structured into:
  - process(): Processes commands and generates events.
  - apply(): Applies events to update aggregate states.

Event sourcing fundamentally reshapes how business logic and data are managed, offering significant benefits for distributed and event-driven systems, although with notable trade-offs.
