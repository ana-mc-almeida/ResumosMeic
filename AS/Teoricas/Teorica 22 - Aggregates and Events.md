# Aggregates and Events

## Business Logic Organization Patterns

This section explains two patterns for structuring business logic:

- Transaction Script Pattern: A procedural approach, suitable for simple logic, where each service method contains the complete logic for a single operation.
- Domain Model Pattern: An object-oriented approach where business logic resides within a network of classes that represent domain concepts. Classes include state and behavior and align closely with real-world entities.

The Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach builds on the Domain Model pattern by introducing:

- Entities: Objects with unique identities.
- Vaue Objects: Stateless objects representing domain values.
- Aggregates: Clusters of objects with defined boundaries and a single entry point (root entity).
- Services and Repositories: Structures to manage logic that doesn't belong to a single entity.

## Designing a Domain Model with the DDD Aggregate Pattern

Aggregates solve problems of fuzzy boundaries and enforce consistency within microservices. Key points include:

- Aggregates group related domain objects into units for operations like load, update, or delete.
- The Aggregate Root acts as the only entry point to ensure that business invariants are maintained.
- References between aggregates use primary keys rather than object references for loose coupling.
- Transactions are scoped to single aggregates, aligning with microservices' transaction constraints.
  It is important to design aggregates carefully to balance scalability, consistency, and modularity. For instance, aggregating "Orders" and "Consumers" increases transactional consistency but reduces scalability.

## Publishing Domain Events

Domain events capture state changes in aggregates and notify other systems. Examples include actions like "Order Created" or "Order Cancelled." Domain events enable:

- Choreography-based sagas: Maintaining data consistency across services.
- Notification systems: Sending updates via emails, texts, or WebSockets.
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS): Updating read models for efficient querying.
