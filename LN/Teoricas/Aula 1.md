### Co-Reference

# Main challenges

- Noise
- Different accents
- Different ages - people with different ages talk differently.
- Context - For example, a mother saying telling her child `At 4pm I will be wating for you outside school!` is different from a bully telling the same.
- Sarcasm and irony
