Uncertainty:

- Aleatoric Uncertainty: Stems from noise in the data (e.g., noisy labels or missing data).
- Epistemic Uncertainty: Arises from the model's lack of knowledge, such as out-of-distribution inputs.
- Methods to estimate uncertainty include Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), Monte Carlo Dropout, and Deep Ensembles.

Explainability:

- Intrinsic Explainability: Some models, like decision trees or linear models, are inherently interpretable.
- Post-hoc Explainability: Techniques like SHAP, LIME, and gradient-based methods provide insights into non-inherently explainable models.
- Attention-based Explanations: Analyzes model decisions through attention weights but has limitations in faithfulness.

Fairness and Ethical AI:

- Ethical concerns include bias, privacy, accessibility, intellectual property, and sustainability.
- Bias in machine learning can result from statistical tendencies or inductive assumptions made by the model.
