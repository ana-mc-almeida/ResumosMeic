In a Stochastic game, each agent can learn separately, ignoring the presence of the other agents in the system. However this approach is inherently flawed: In an environment with multiple learning agents, the (hypothetical) transition model of agent may be changing continuously due to the policy of the other agents (who are also learning).

Although independent Q-learning cannot be justified theoretically, the method has been employed in practice with reported success.
